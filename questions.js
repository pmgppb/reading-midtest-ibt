            Although the rooftop space had fewer plant var<span class="slot">[6]</span>ties, it at<span class="slot">[7]</span>ted a surprising range of bees and butterflies.

            In many coastal reg<span class="slot">[11]</span>s, mangrove forests act as natural barri<span class="slot">[12]</span>s during storms.
            Their tangled roots slow moving water, trap sediment, and create shel<span class="slot">[13]</span>ed areas where young fish can develop.
            Scientists have also found that mangrove soils can store sub<span class="slot">[14]</span>tial amounts of carbon.
            Yet these forests are often cl<span class="slot">[15]</span>ed for construction or aquacul<span class="slot">[16]</span>re.
            Recent res<span class="slot">[17]</span>ation projects suggest that protecting ex<span class="slot">[18]</span>ing mangroves may be more ef<span class="slot">[19]</span>cient than rebuilding them after exte<span class="slot">[20]</span>ive damage has occurred.

          <h3>Biology: Why Some Seeds Remain Dormant</h3>
          <p>Many plants produce seeds that do not germinate immediately after they mature. This condition, known as seed dormancy, can appear to be inefficient because a dormant seed does not produce a new plant at once. However, dormancy can protect a species when environmental conditions are temporarily unsuitable. A seed may remain inactive until temperature, moisture, or light reaches a level favorable for growth.</p>
          <p>Dormancy also changes the timing of competition. If every seed germinated as soon as it became mature, a sudden period of drought could eliminate a large group of seedlings at the same time. By spreading germination across different seasons or years, a plant population reduces the risk that one unfavorable period will affect every new individual. Some seeds therefore remain dormant for several years.</p>
          <p>Scientists distinguish between forms of dormancy. In physical dormancy, a hard seed coat prevents water from entering. In physiological dormancy, chemical conditions inside the seed inhibit growth. Some species combine these mechanisms. Researchers study such differences because agricultural crops with predictable germination are easier to manage, while wild plants may benefit from more variable timing. Thus, dormancy should not be viewed simply as delayed growth; it is a strategy that can improve survival in uncertain environments.</p>

          <h3>History: Markets and the Growth of Medieval Towns</h3>
          <p>In medieval Europe, markets were more than places where goods were exchanged. Regular markets created predictable opportunities for farmers, artisans, and traveling merchants to meet. As these gatherings became more frequent, settlements near market sites could attract permanent shops and workshops. Over time, some small settlements developed into towns with more specialized economic activity.</p>
          <p>The growth of a market did not automatically guarantee urban expansion. Roads, political protection, and access to water were also important. A market located on a difficult-to-reach hill, for example, might attract fewer traders than one situated near a river crossing. Local rulers sometimes encouraged markets because they could collect fees from commerce, but those same rulers also had to maintain order and protect traders.</p>
          <p>Markets therefore influenced town development through several connected processes. They increased the frequency of economic interaction, encouraged specialization, and could attract people who provided services to merchants. Yet their effects depended on geography and political conditions. The development of a town was usually the result of several reinforcing factors rather than a single economic event.</p>

          <h3>Urban Trees and Heat</h3>
          <p>Cities often experience higher temperatures than nearby rural areas, a pattern commonly called the urban heat island effect. Buildings and paved surfaces absorb solar energy during the day and release it slowly after sunset. Trees can modify this pattern in several ways. Their leaves provide shade, while water released through transpiration can cool the surrounding air.</p>
          <p>However, the cooling effect of urban trees depends on location and maintenance. A tree planted where tall buildings block sunlight may grow slowly and provide limited shade. Trees that are not watered during extended droughts may also lose leaves, reducing their cooling contribution. In addition, the benefits of a tree are not distributed evenly across a city. Neighborhoods with fewer mature trees may remain substantially warmer. For these reasons, urban forestry programs increasingly focus on strategic placement rather than simply counting the number of trees planted. Researchers may combine temperature measurements with information about street design, building height, and tree canopy. The goal is to identify locations where new vegetation is most likely to reduce heat exposure for residents.</p>
